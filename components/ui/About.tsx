    <li>Hey, I&apos;m <strong>Sowmya Yarramsetti</strong>, a 20-year-old student from Andhra Pradesh, India. I am a daughter, sister, friend, civil engineering enthusiast, and a passionate learner.</li>
    <li>As my age suggests, I&apos;m a student who has completed a diploma in Civil Engineering, specializing in AutoCAD , and I am currently in my final year of B.Tech in Civil Engineering.</li>
    <li>My journey in civil engineering started during my Diploma 1st year, where I developed a strong passion for design and construction.</li>
    <li>I&apos;m proficient in tools like AutoCAD, STAAD.Pro, 3ds Max, CypeCAD, and Primavera, which have helped me create detailed designs and realistic visualizations for various projects.</li>
    <li>I&apos;m eager to apply my expertise in a dynamic role where I can contribute to the successful execution of cutting-edge engineering projects, fostering innovation and excellence at every stage.</li>
    <li>My experience includes streamlining design workflows and integrating various tools to enhance efficiency and shorten project timelines.</li>
    <li>In my free time, I enjoy drawing, painting, traveling, and cooking.</li>
    <li>I don&apos;t talk much over any platform, but I do like making friendsâ€”whether online or in real life, though I&apos;m somewhat introverted.</li>
    <li>So, if you ever want to talk about anything, feel free to hit me up. I&apos;ll get back to you as soon as I&apos;m active/online.</li>
    <li>That&apos;s pretty much everything I know about myself so far. If you have anything to share or want to connect, feel free to connect with me.</li>
